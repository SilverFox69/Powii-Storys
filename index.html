  <p id="text"><!--The story-->


    The world of the story consists of 2 dimensions, the human dimension and the monster one.
    The humans are powerless against the other dimension’s creatures and especially to their close neighbors, the ghosts. 
    The Xcompany as they call themselves though has been in the process of making weapons against the creatures. 
    Although it is not directly supported by the government,
    due to it disturbing the delicate peace among the two dimensions, it is believed by many that their activities are continuing
    with the constant help of people in high positions.
    Beam was a “redacted” year old boy whose parents strongly believed in the Xcomplanies’ plans.
    They signed up their only son to their experiments. By signing him not only did they agree to give
    him up but to have him wiped from all of the files that existed about him. 
    The experiment that Beam took part in was an attempt to make the “ultimate” weapon.
    A human that was part ghost with enhanced abilities. Beam wasn’t the first one to take part in, there were 206 failed attempts
    before him so most hope was already lost. It was a miracle that Beam survived. 
    Being the first one to succeed his was pretty weak and unstable, so he was too though tof a failed attempt.
    Scientist still continue to experiment on him to test their theories. Beam succeeded in showing traces of common ghost abilities like teleporting,
    telekinesis, invisibility and a very weak form of mind control that represented telepathy to a point.
    Then one day someone reported the secret lab’s existence to the authorities. The lab was soon in chaos.
    The scientist team grabbed their most successful experiments and fled whule they left behind the failed tests, Beam was one of them.
    After discovering Beam the government didn’t know exactly what to do.
    They tried camouflaging and giving him foster parents since announcing the discovery to the public would alarm the neighbors and probably cause conflict.
    When that didn’t work out they decided to ban him from the realm completely.
    Not welcome in either dimension Beam searched for a new home.
    He ended up at the Leftover realm where creatures who don’t have a home or are not welcome go.
    He still visits the Human realm to meet up with Austin,
    his previous foster parents’ kid,
    who was the only person he could trust since he was the only one to care about him.
    He now is searching alongside with Austin to end the Xcompany and their experiments.
